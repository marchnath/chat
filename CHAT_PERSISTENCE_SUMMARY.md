# Chat Persistence Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented local storage functionality for your chat app to persist conversations between sessions. Here's what was added:

## New Features

### 1. **Local Storage System** (`/lib/chatStorage.js`)

- Saves conversations per contact using localStorage
- Stores messages, hints, translations, and timestamps
- Provides functions to save, load, and clear conversations
- Uses contact-specific keys to isolate conversations

### 2. **Enhanced useChat Hook** (`/hooks/useChat.js`)

- Now accepts `contactName` parameter to identify conversations
- Automatically loads saved conversations on mount
- Saves conversation data whenever state changes (debounced to 500ms)
- Added `clearChat()` function to reset conversations
- Added `isConversationLoaded` state to prevent premature initial hint setting

### 3. **Improved Chat Interface** (`/components/ChatInterface.jsx`)

- Passes contact name to useChat hook
- Waits for conversation to load before setting initial hints
- Provides clear chat functionality to header component

### 4. **Enhanced Chat Header** (`/components/ChatHeader.jsx`)

- Added dropdown menu with "Clear Chat" option
- Includes confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion
- Supports keyboard navigation (Escape key to close)
- Click outside to close menu functionality

### 5. **Visual Message Indicators** (`/components/ContactList.jsx`)

- Shows blue badge with message count on contacts that have saved conversations
- Automatically refreshes when returning from chats
- Listens for storage changes and window focus events

### 6. **Debug Utilities** (`/lib/chatDebug.js`)

- Development-only debugging functions available in browser console
- `debugChats()` - View all saved conversations
- `getStorageStats()` - Get storage statistics
- `debugClearAll()` - Clear all conversations with confirmation

## How It Works

### Persistence

- Each conversation is stored with a unique key: `textipal-conversations-{contact-name}`
- Data includes: messages, current hint, translations, and last updated timestamp
- Conversations are saved automatically 500ms after any change

### User Experience

- **Returning to chat**: Last messages and hints are restored exactly as they were
- **Clear chat**: Click the "⋮" button in chat header → "Clear Chat" → confirm
- **Visual feedback**: Blue badges on home screen show which contacts have saved messages
- **Seamless**: No loading indicators needed, conversations load instantly

### Data Structure

Each saved conversation contains:

```javascript
{
  messages: [...], // Array of message objects
  currentHint: "...", // Current hint text
  messageTranslations: {...}, // Message translations cache
  hintTranslation: "...", // Current hint translation
  lastUpdated: "2025-01-XX..." // ISO timestamp
}
```

## Usage

### For Users

1. Start chatting with any contact
2. Messages and hints are automatically saved
3. Leave and return - conversation continues exactly where you left off
4. To clear: Chat header → ⋮ → Clear Chat → Confirm

### For Developers (in browser console)

```javascript
debugChats(); // View all conversations
getStorageStats(); // Get storage stats
debugClearAll(); // Clear all with confirmation
```

## Benefits

- ✅ No database needed for testing
- ✅ Conversations persist between browser sessions
- ✅ Last AI message and hints are maintained
- ✅ Easy to clear individual conversations
- ✅ Visual indicators for saved conversations
- ✅ Automatic save (no manual action needed)
- ✅ Confirmation before deletion
- ✅ Debug tools for development

The implementation is production-ready and provides a complete local persistence solution for your chat application!
